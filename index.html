<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
<p>The Geraldine Clarice College Fund was created to honor Geraldine C. Blakey’s love, wisdom, mentorship, and value for education. In summary, her richness in morals and values made her one of the pillars that she is in her family. She consistently contributed everything she could to the world, and always showed up in the most critical moments for her loved ones. </p>
  
   Devin Young (her youngest grandson), studies and identifies with those same values, and intends on impacting the future generations of leaders with those same values. </p> 
  
   This college fund that he's created will provide both financial support and mentorship to help family members and family friends succeed in higher education.</p>

<h2>Importance of the Mission</h2>

<p>It's important to collectively build upon the knowledge and opportunity that every generation before us has made possible. Individual knowledge and success only propels communities when the resources that are obtained from those who have achieved are evenly distributed to those communities as a whole, as opposed to a select few.
