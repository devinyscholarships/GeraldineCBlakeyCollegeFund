<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p>The Geraldine Clarice College Fund was created to honor Geraldine C. Blakey’s love, wisdom, mentorship, and value for education. In summary, her richness in morals and values made her the pillar that she is in her family. She consistently gave everything she could give to her loved ones, and showed up in the most critical moments. </p>
  
   Devin Young (her youngest grandson), studies and identifies with those same values, and intends on impacting the future generations of leaders with those same values. </p> 
  
   This college fund that he's created will provide both financial support and mentorship to help family members and family friends succeed in higher education.</p> .</p>
