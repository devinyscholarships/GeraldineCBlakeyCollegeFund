<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
<p>The Geraldine Clarice College Fund was created to honor Geraldine C. Blakey’s love, wisdom, mentorship, and value for education. Her richness in morals and values made her a cornerstone of her family, and her selflessness meant she always showed up in the most critical moments for those she loved, giving her all to support others.  </p> 

Devin Young, her youngest grandson, embraces these same values and is committed to shaping future generations of leaders in the same spirit.  </p> 

Through this fund, he provides both financial support and mentorship to help family members and family friends succeed in higher education. </p>

<h2>Importance of the Mission</h2>

<p> When individual success is shared, it has the power to strengthen entire communities. The knowledge and opportunities passed down by previous generations are meant to be built upon and shared, ensuring that resources, wisdom, and achievements benefit all—not just a select few. In doing so, we continue a legacy of growth, opportunity, and collective prosperity.
