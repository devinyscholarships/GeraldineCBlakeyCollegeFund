<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
<p>The Geraldine Clarice College Fund was created to honor Geraldine C. Blakey’s love, wisdom, mentorship, and value for education. Her richness in morals and values made her a cornerstone of her family, and her selflessness meant she always showed up in the most critical moments for those she loved, giving her all to support others.  </p> 

Devin Young, her youngest grandson, embraces these same values and is committed to shaping future generations of leaders in the same spirit.  </p> 

Through this fund, he provides both financial support and mentorship to help family members and family friends succeed in higher education. </p>

<h2>Importance of the Mission</h2>

<p>It's important to collectively build upon the knowledge and opportunity that every generation before us has made possible. Individual knowledge and success only propels communities when the resources that are obtained from those who have achieved are evenly distributed to those communities as a whole, as opposed to a select few.
