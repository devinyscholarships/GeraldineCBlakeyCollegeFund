<h2>What Inspired the Creation of this Opportunity?</h2>
<p> For one, the lack of direct assistance or guideline for the type of success that Devin Young wished to achieve when starting out, given his background and generation that he belongs to. </p>

    Secondly, from a moral standpoint, Devin Young believes that his legacy is defined by what he gives to the world, and not what he as an individual, gains from it. </p>

    Thirdly, Devin Young believes in creating/finding opportunities and not waiting on them to be given. </p>
    
    Lastly, Devin Young wants to use a part of what motivated him to carry out his collegiate career the way that he did, to assist and motivate future generations to pursue the paths that they choose to take. </p>

  <h2>Credibility</h2>
  <p>
    Achievement wise, Devin Young recently graduated from Bowie State University in just 3 years with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Information Technology, earning a 3.9 cumulative GPA. </p> 

    In addition, his total gross income over the course of the 3 years that he was enrolled in higher education exceeded $50,000, allowing him to primarily depend on his own finances for every day life and all responsibilities that come with a means for transportation. </p>

    He did this all from his hometown (Temple Hills, MD)... without a blueprint, fundraiser, or middle man. </p>

<h2>Quote</h2>
<p>“We look at life like it's about what you can get from it, which will always leave us unfulfilled. It's about knowing we're going to leave one day, and the only way we will be fulfilled is if we know we gave everything we had and emptied ourselves here.” – Nipsey Hussle </p>
