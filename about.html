<h2>What Inspired the Creation of this Opportunity?</h2>
    
<p> Devin Young created this program to provide others with the practical guidance and support he lacked when starting out, particularly in navigating today’s collegiate landscape and exploring professional opportunities while in school. <p>
    
    He believes that his legacy is defined by what he gives to the world, not what he gains. <p>
        
    Through this program, which spans participants’ entire undergraduate careers, he strives to encourage and guide future generations as they pursue their own paths with confidence and purpose <p>

  <h2>Credibility</h2>
  <p>
    On the academic front, Devin Young recently graduated from Bowie State University in just 3 years with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Information Technology, earning a 3.9 cumulative GPA. </p> 

    During his three years in higher education, he also financially supported himself through academic scholarships and four internships—experiencing both HBCU and PWI environments and collaborating with a diverse range of peers—while covering daily expenses and larger adult responsibilities as a full-time student. </p>

    He achieved all of this from his hometown of Temple Hills, MD—without a blueprint, fundraiser, academic or Greek organization, or relying solely on a middleman to access opportunities. </p>

<h2>Quote</h2>
<p>“We look at life like it's about what you can get from it, which will always leave us unfulfilled. It's about knowing we're going to leave one day, and the only way we will be fulfilled is if we know we gave everything we had and emptied ourselves here.” – Nipsey Hussle </p>
