<h2>What Inspired the Creation of this Opportunity?</h2>
<p> For one, the lack of a guideline or direct assistance for the type of success that Devin Young wished to achieve when starting out, given his background and generation that he belongs to. </p>

    Secondly, from a moral standpoint, Devin Young believes that his legacy is defined by what he gives to the world, and not what he as an individual, gains from it. </p>

    Thirdly, Devin Young wants to use a part of what motivated him to carry out his collegiate career the way that he did, to assist and motivate future generations to pursue the paths that they choose to take. </p>

  <h2>Credibility</h2>
  <p>
    Achievement wise, Devin Young recently graduated from Bowie State University in just 3 years with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Information Technology, earning a 3.9 cumulative GPA. 

    In addition, his total gross income over the course of the 3 years that he was enrolled in higher education exceeded $50,000, allowing him to primarily depend on his own finances for every day life and a means for transportation, including everything that comes with being responsible for that transportation.

    He did this all from his hometown, Temple Hills (Maryland), without a blueprint, fundraiser, or a middle man.
