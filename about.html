<h2>What Inspired the Creation of this Opportunity?</h2>
<p> Devin Young created this program to give others more guidance and assistance than he had starting out. <p> 
    
    He believes that a true legacy is defined by what you give, not what you gain. <p>
        
    Through this program, he aims to motivate and support future generations in pursuing their chosen paths. <p>

  <h2>Credibility</h2>
  <p>
    Achievement wise, Devin Young recently graduated from Bowie State University in just 3 years with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Information Technology, earning a 3.9 cumulative GPA. </p> 

    In addition, his total gross income over the course of the 3 years that he was enrolled in higher education exceeded $50,000, allowing him to primarily depend on his own finances for every day life and all responsibilities that come with a means for transportation. </p>

    He did this all from his hometown (Temple Hills, MD)... without relying on a blueprint, fundraiser, academic/greek organization, or a middle man to obtain opportunities. </p>

<h2>Quote</h2>
<p>“We look at life like it's about what you can get from it, which will always leave us unfulfilled. It's about knowing we're going to leave one day, and the only way we will be fulfilled is if we know we gave everything we had and emptied ourselves here.” – Nipsey Hussle </p>
